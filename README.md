A team of four UC Berkeley graduate students spent the semester building machine learning models to predict US Open Tennis Winners. In just a few sentences, one can surely understand the vast amount of data, statistics, and information that can be attributed to a seasoned professional; the world ranking of a player, the total number of sets a player won,  the number of forced errors a player makes, and so forth. With data in mind, the goal of this project is to investigate the applicability of utilizing machine learning algorithms to predict the winner of the 2020 U.S. Open tennis tournament. 

The reasoning for taking the opportunity to further analyze the U.S. Open tennis tournaments derive from the group’s interest in tennis. Using data that revealed information about a player’s current statistics from the previous 52 weeks of playing, the group wanted to see how accurate a model could be made to correctly predict winners of this tournament. Could models predict upsets? Could the model predict semi-finalists and the true winner? These were all questions that we would soon learn.

Further purpose of creating a model that could predict tennis tournament winners with a high level of accuracy would be to increase profitability if one was a gambler and wanted to cash in on a player with high odds of winning. On the contrary, an odds making site or a casino could use this type of model to help adjust their odds so they could minimize their payout to gamblers. Evenmore so, companies that sponsor players such as Head, Penn, Nike, etc. could use this type of modeling on less significant tournaments to find the next “star” player to sponsor. 

The following machine learning models were utilized:
- Logistic Regression
- CART
- Random Forest
- Neural Networks
- Principal Component Regression
